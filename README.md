# Phantom-Tracker

Welcome to Phantom Tracker, A sophisticated mod that uses packets from phantoms to be sent to a players client with in game coordinates attached.

This is the most powerful coordinate exploit made by Severedprince and Mewover!

TODO: Add files to the correct location (gradle is not compiling because I need everything sorted like the tree below for it to work). I JUST COMPILED IT AND IT WORKED BABY!!!
